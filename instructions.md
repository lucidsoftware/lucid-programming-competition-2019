## Compete

The competition will be available at  [https://www.hackerrank.com/lucid-2019-cu](https://www.hackerrank.com/lucid-2019-cu).

At the start of the competition, you will also receive a hard copy of the problems.

The leaderboard will be available at  [https://contest.golucid.co/](https://contest.golucid.co/). It will be publicly frozen one hour prior to the end of the contest.

## Additional info

Input may or may not end with a trailing new line. Extra whitespace is ignored in output. Sometimes a certain numerical accuracy is required of output; in these cases you may print the answer with any number of digits, as long as it is within the requisite range.

Before submitting, it is recommended that you run your code against the samples. HackerRank shows you stdout and stderr when running in this manner.

This contest is sponsored by Lucid Software ([https://golucid.co/](https://golucid.co/)).
