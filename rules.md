# Rules

## Participation

This contest is open to all college students. Each team may have up to three members.

## Problems

There are 10 problems focusing on reasoning and algorithmic problem solving. Each problem has a description, input format, output format, and samples.

Requests for clarification may be submitted to `lucidsoftware` via [https://www.hackerrank.com/inbox](https://www.hackerrank.com/inbox). Each problem has been carefully reviewed for clarity and correctness, so it is unlikely that any further information will be given. If ambiguity or error is discovered, all contestants will be notified at [https://www.hackerrank.com/notifications](https://www.hackerrank.com/notifications).

## Submissions

A submission consists of your source code, in one file, limited to 50kb. For details on compilers, runtimes, and time and memory limits, see [https://www.hackerrank.com/environment](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment). The time and memory limits are the same for all problems.

Input is given on stdin and output is expected on stdout. See  [https://www.hackerrank.com/environment/sample-problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment/sample-problem) for examples in various languages.

## Scoring

Scoring is done [ACM ICPC-style](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules):

1. Score is the number of problems correctly solved.
1. To break ties, sum the solved times, plus 20 minutes for incorrect submissions to solved problems. The smallest time wins.

## Resources

Each team has 1 computer and sufficient writing materials. External resources are limited to standard language and API documentation. Other resources -- e.g. StackOverflow, Wikipedia, blogs -- are not allowed. Teams who access any disallowed resources will be disqualified.

For example, the following are acceptable resources:

| Language | References |
| -------- | ---------- |
| C++ | [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/) |
| Java | [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/) |
