# Add Pumpkin

Let's say we have pumpkin as P, ghost as G, and
P + P = P
G + P = G
P + G = G
G + G = GP

Given two strings with only P and G, return their sum (also a string with P and G).
The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters P or G.

# Example 1

**Input**: a = "GG", b = "G"
**Output**: "GPP"

# Example 2

**Input**: a = "GPGP", b = "GPGG"
**Output**: "GPGPG"
