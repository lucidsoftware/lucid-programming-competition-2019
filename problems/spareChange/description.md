# (not) Spare Change

## Description
The little old lady down the street has the best treats every year, but she's a little weird. She bags these delicious treats in sets of her favorite numbers, but is very insistant on only letting trick-or-treaters take exactly a certain amount in total -- no more, no less! She has seemingly infinite numbers of each size of bag, but you have personal hangups about not appearing greedy, so take the fewest number of bags to reach that target count. 

## Input
The first line has space separated integers representing the old lady's favorite numbers. The second line contains the integer target value.

## Output
A single integer representing the minimum number of bags needed to reach the target value. -1 if it's impossible.
