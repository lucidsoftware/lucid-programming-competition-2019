# i18n

Internationalization. What a long word, am I right? Because there are eighteen letters between the first and last, it is often abbreviated as i18n (I-eighteen-N), which so much shorter!

Lucid Software recently internationalized its products and translated them into many different languages. Using "i18n" instead of "internationalization" has saved a lot of time in conversations. We want to do this more.

Apply this same abbreviation method (replacing the inner characters with the number of inner characters) to the provided words. Do not apply this abbreviation if the word has no inner characters.

## Input

The first line is an integer 1 <= W <= 100, the number of words to abbreviate.
The next W lines are 1 to 30 (inclusive) lowercase ASCII letters.

## Output

Print W lines where each line is the abbreviated form of the word.
